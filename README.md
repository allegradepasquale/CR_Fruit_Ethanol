Data and code supporting Casorso, DePasquale, et al. titled, "Seed dispersal syndrome predicts ethanol concentration of fruits in a tropical dry forest"


Our respository contains 3 scripts and 3 corresponding data files:

"Casorso et al. 2023_PGLS_Analyses.R"
- Allows reproduction of phylogenetic least squares regression analyses
-Requires the file "Casorso et al. 2023 - Ethanol and Dispersal Syndrome.txt"

"Casorso et al. 2023_Phylogenetic (Lambda) Analyses.R"
-Allows reproduction of Pagel's lambda analysis testing for phylogenetic signal 
-Requires the file "Casorso et al. 2023 - Summary Statistics for Fruit Species.txt"


"Casorso et al. 2023_Phylogenetic Tree Creation.R"
-Allows reproduction of phylogenetic tree recreation
-Requires the file "Casorso et al. 2023 - Species List for Phylogenetic Tree.txt"

Our repository also contains our Supplemental Dataset, containing the ethanol generated in our study.
